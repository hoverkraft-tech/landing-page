> 🚀 Technical excellence does not wait for 100 developers.

Platform Engineering is often associated with digital giants. This perception holds back CTOs of SMEs who fear out-of-reach investments. Yet the blockers that slow down production releases are identical for all teams: lack of automation, documentation debt, fragmented observability.

Openkraft is our open-source answer to make these practices pragmatic. We have condensed our technical building blocks, playbooks, and metrics into a connector-first approach that you activate at your own pace.

## Why platforms still seem inaccessible

- **Team size**: myth of the 50-developer threshold when 8 to 12 are enough to justify an internal portal.
- **Budget**: projection of 6 to 12 months of build when an MVP foundation can be achieved in 6 to 8 weeks by leveraging ready-to-use connectors.
- **Complexity**: tool stacking without governance when workflows are not mapped.

DORA metrics show that deployment frequency is multiplied by 2.4 on average when a team activates a self-service pipeline + IaC + shared observability. The goal is not to copy Netflix, but to eliminate measurable frictions: change lead time, failure rate, restoration time.

## Openkraft in three directly usable modules

- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions and GitLab workflows, pipeline templates, and domain-specific triggers.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform modules, Crossplane compositions, OPA policies to ensure compliance.
- **Observability & security**: Prometheus/Loki stack, OpenTelemetry collection, Trivy/Snyk scanners, and Vault secrets management.

Each module is published under MIT or Apache 2.0 license, accompanied by runbook guides to accelerate adoption. The diagram below illustrates the interconnection of these blocks around an Openkraft core.

## Openkraft versus market solutions

The Platform Engineering ecosystem already offers several recognized tools:

- **Backstage** (Spotify): unified developer portal, service catalog, project templates. Excellent for centralizing discovery but requires significant investment in plugins and maintenance.
- **Port.io**: commercial platform with no-code interface, ready-to-use integrations. SaaS model that can create proprietary lock-in and escalating costs.
- **CNOE** (Cloud Native Operational Excellence): CNCF initiative that standardizes platform patterns on Kubernetes. Complementary community approach but less operational as-is.

**Openkraft positions itself differently**: we do not build a monolithic portal but a collection of modular connectors that you assemble according to your constraints.

You can combine Backstage as UI and Openkraft for pipelines, or use only our Terraform modules if you already have a CI/CD stack. The goal is to accelerate your delivery without imposing a complete framework.

Unlike proprietary solutions, each Openkraft building block is auditable, forkable, and deployable on-premise. You keep control of your technical trajectory.

## 3 sprints to launch the approach

We structure support over three two-week sprints to obtain visible results without immobilizing your teams.

1. **Explore**: rapid audit, delivery flow mapping, connector prioritization, and target metric definition.
2. **Experiment**: pilot project deployment, self-service portal activation, baseline DORA metrics collection.
3. **Industrialize**: extension to other teams, security control automation, living documentation, and lightweight governance.

## Measure to learn

- **Change lead time**: target < 48h between merge and production on the pilot.
- **Failure rate**: limit rollbacks to < 10% through automated validations.
- **Restoration time**: integrate runbooks into Grafana and aim for < 1h on critical incidents.
- **Developer experience**: internal NPS measured at 30 days, tracked in our SPACE dashboard.

We deliver a shared dashboard (Grafana + GitHub Insights) to quickly visualize gains and identify next levers.

## What you gain concretely

- **Startups (5-30 devs)**: self-service portal operational in 10 days, deployment frequency x2.
- **Scale-ups (30-150 devs)**: homogeneous environments, 40% reduced onboarding, documented compliance.
- **Mature platform teams**: 3 to 6 months of build saved, governance clarified via API contracts and policies-as-code.

These results come from missions carried out in 2024-2025 with SaaS, fintech, and industry players, measured via DORA/SPACE.

## Move from talk to impact

Platform Engineering is no longer a luxury. With Openkraft, you activate a modular, measurable, and open platform that aligns your product, dev, and ops teams around shared indicators.
