> 📦 Publishing Docker images across an organization should not be hard. With the right tools, it becomes effortless.

## The Problem: Why It Gets Complicated

Setting up Docker image publishing workflows in an organization quickly becomes a headache. Between managing Dockerfiles, maintaining CI/CD pipelines, applying security policies, and synchronizing versions, teams spend more time on plumbing than on business value.

Common pain points:

- **Duplication**: every team reinvents their own pipelines
- **Inconsistency**: different practices across projects
- **Maintenance**: dozens of workflows to update when something changes
- **Security**: vulnerability scans forgotten or misconfigured

## Our Solution: Reusable Workflows and Golden Path

At Hoverkraft, we built a set of reusable GitHub Actions workflows to industrialize Docker image management. The [hoverkraft-tech/docker-base-images](https://github.com/hoverkraft-tech/docker-base-images) project provides a solid foundation to get started.

We also provide a [Golden Path](https://docs.hoverkraft.cloud/docs/methodology/golden-paths/docker-base-images/) to help you bootstrap your own Docker base images repository following proven best practices.

### What You Get

- **Multi-architecture builds**: native AMD64 and ARM64 support
- **Security scanning**: Trivy integrated in every pipeline
- **Automatic versioning**: semantic tags based on Git
- **Registry agnostic**: GitHub Container Registry, Docker Hub, or your private registry
- **OCI metadata**: standardized labels for complete traceability

## Getting Started in 3 Steps

### 1. Create Your Base Images Repository

Follow our [Golden Path documentation](https://docs.hoverkraft.cloud/docs/methodology/golden-paths/docker-base-images/) to bootstrap your own Docker images repository.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/build.yml
name: Build Docker Images
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
jobs:
  build:
    uses: hoverkraft-tech/docker-base-images/.github/workflows/build.yml@main
    with:
      image-name: my-org/my-image
```

### 2. Configure Your Images

Structure your Dockerfiles in dedicated folders. The workflow automatically detects changes and only rebuilds what changed.

```text
images/
├── node/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── context/
├── python/
│   └── Dockerfile
└── golang/
    └── Dockerfile
```

### 3. Enjoy the Automation

On every push, the workflow:

1. Detects modified images
2. Builds in parallel across all architectures
3. Scans for vulnerabilities
4. Publishes with appropriate tags
5. Updates metadata

## Measurable Benefits

By adopting this approach, our clients report:

- ⏱️ **Setup time**: from several days to under 30 minutes
- 🔄 **Maintenance**: single source of truth for all workflows
- 🔒 **Security**: systematic scanning with zero extra effort
- 📈 **Scalability**: add a new image in just a few lines

## Go Further

The [complete documentation](https://docs.hoverkraft.cloud/docs/projects/docker-base-images/) covers all configuration options: multi-registry, Cosign signatures, Slack notifications, and more.
