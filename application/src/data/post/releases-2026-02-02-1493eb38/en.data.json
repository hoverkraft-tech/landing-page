The ci-github-publish repository also had a significant update with the release of version 0.21.0 on February 1, 2026. The ci-github-common repository contributed one release during this period, highlighting ongoing development across these components.\n\n- The release of terraform-modules enhances the flexibility and scalability of infrastructure management, which is crucial for platform engineers managing cloud resources.\n- The update to ci-github-publish improves the CI/CD pipeline efficiency, allowing SREs to streamline deployment processes and reduce potential downtime.\n- ci-github-common's release, while limited in scope, provides foundational tools that support integration efforts, making it easier for technical contributors to adopt and implement HoverKraft projects effectively.",
