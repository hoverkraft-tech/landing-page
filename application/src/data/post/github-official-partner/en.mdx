> 🚀 GitHub now recognizes Hoverkraft as an official partner.

We are proud to announce that Hoverkraft is now an **official GitHub partner organization**. This recognition validates our commitment to building reliable, open, and measured delivery platforms with GitHub Actions at the core.

It also reflects three years of sustained effort: production-grade workflows, solid tooling, and an unapologetic open-source philosophy. Several months of certification were required to prove our rigor on security, governance, and developer experience.

## Why this partnership matters

The [GitHub Partner Program](https://partner.github.com/) gives us deeper alignment with GitHub standards and product roadmaps. It strengthens our mission: a **connector-first architecture** that protects technical sovereignty while staying open.

It also shortens feedback loops with GitHub engineering teams worldwide every week.

What that means in practice:

- Preferred access to GitHub Actions best practices and upcoming capabilities.
- Workflow hardening aligned with GitHub security and compliance expectations.
- The Verified Creator badge on our actions confirms GitHub has validated Hoverkraft as a partner organization.
- Open-source connectors that stay documented, maintainable, and reusable.
- Technical sovereignty without proprietary lock-in.

## Three years of industrializing GitHub Actions

We treat GitHub Actions as the platform backbone, not just a CI/CD tool. This **platform as a delivery chain** mindset drove us to build reusable blocks, security guardrails, and observable pipelines.

Our focus has been on:

- Production-grade workflows with secrets, approvals, and fast rollback paths.
- Versioned templates that cut onboarding time and reduce drift.
- Built-in observability for deployments and reliability signals.
- Open-source governance that makes contribution safe and scalable.

## Open source as a foundation

This partnership is also about community. We publish actions, connectors, and tooling so teams can audit, reuse, and improve the delivery chain. It is how we keep transparency and technical sovereignty practical, not theoretical.

We share:

- Reusable GitHub Actions for build, security scans, and releases.
- Documented connectors that bridge services and developer portals.
- Guides and templates to industrialize workflows faster.

## A demanding certification process

GitHub certification requires proof, not promises. We went through months of audits to demonstrate tooling quality, security posture, and the ability to support mission-critical teams.

It also validated how we work: workflow reviews, systematic code review, and data-driven coaching. **Developer experience is the product** is a discipline we can now prove.

## What changes for your teams

You now have a partner who can align GitHub Actions, architecture choices, and business outcomes. Measured with [DORA](https://dora.dev/) and [SPACE](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3454124), we keep delivery performance and team health visible.

We help you:

- Shorten lead time while protecting release reliability.
- Industrialize pipelines without sacrificing quality.
- Publish open-source connectors to accelerate your ecosystem.
- Preserve technical sovereignty while staying cloud native.

We also help teams establish the rituals that keep the delivery chain healthy: shared workflow libraries, incident-ready runbooks, and inner-source contribution paths.

## What comes next

This partnership opens a new phase: deeper collaboration with GitHub, richer field feedback, and faster delivery platforms. It reinforces our ability to ship measurable, evolutive delivery chains.
