> ðŸš€ Platform engineering is no longer about stacking tools. It is the operating system for delivery, and Hoverkraft treats it as such.

Software teams that win today orchestrate velocity, reliability, and sovereignty at the same time. Over the last decade we have learned that a successful platform is connector-first: it glues the existing ecosystem, measures value continuously, and keeps developers focused on shipping. Here are the 11 characteristics we require on every Hoverkraft engagement.

<Image src={architectureOverview} alt="Architecture overview of a Hoverkraft delivery platform" loading="lazy" />

## 1. Developer experience is the product

Every friction a developer hits turns into stalled deliveries and shadow tooling. We provide:

- A single entry point (Backstage or Portainer) for services, deployments, and documentation.
- Opinionated templates and devcontainers so onboarding stays under 30 minutes.
- Documentation that is generated from IaC manifests and lives with the code.

**Metric to track:** onboarding time, SPACE satisfaction score, support tickets related to environment issues.

## 2. Evidence-driven decisions

Dashboards are first-class citizens. We expose DORA and SPACE signals to product, platform, and leadership. Alerting is proactive and every connector emits structured telemetry.

**Metric to track:** deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, change failure rate.

## 3. Automation end to end

Manual steps are risks. GitOps, pipelines-as-code, and automated testing (quality, security, performance) guarantee repeatability. When something fails, rollback takes minutes, not hours.

## 4. Connector-first glue

We avoid proprietary monoliths. Hoverkraft maintains open-source connectors that keep stacks interchangeable and documented. Integrations use standard APIs, webhooks, and schemas so every team can extend the platform safely.

## 5. Cloud-native and portable

Kubernetes is the lingua franca, but sovereignty matters. We design so workloads can move between OVHcloud, AWS, on-prem, or Sovereign Cloud France without rewriting applications.

## 6. Security by design

Secrets management, automated vulnerability scanning, policy-as-code, and exhaustive audit trails are baked in from sprint zero. Least privilege is the default, not an afterthought.

## 7. Built for scale and resilience

Horizontal and vertical autoscaling, chaos engineering playbooks, and multi-region topologies ensure resilience under pressure. Business continuity is measurable, not aspirational.

## 8. API-first interoperability

Service catalogs, OpenAPI/AsyncAPI contracts, and change governance prevent the emergence of brittle point-to-point scripts. Every connector ships with examples and rollback stories.

<Image src={swaggerDocs} alt="Swagger generated documentation" loading="lazy" />

## 9. Collaborative governance

We align architecture guilds, platform squads, and compliance early. Decision records are transparent, and shared scorecards highlight where to invest next.

## 10. Sustainable pace

Developer wellbeing is a leading indicator. We instrument SPACE surveys, track toil, and invest in pairings and communities of practice.

## 11. Sovereignty and reversibility

Your platform remains yours. Knowledge transfer, open-source assets, and clear offboarding rituals make sure you can accelerate autonomously.

## Bringing it together

Hoverkraft engagements combine these traits into a tangible transformation roadmap:

<Image src={hoverkraftJourney} alt="Hoverkraft journey timeline" loading="lazy" />

1. **Diagnostic** â€“ two days of SPACE/DORA analysis, connector mapping, and interviews.
2. **Action plan** â€“ a six-month roadmap with quick wins and structural milestones.
3. **Connector rollout** â€“ laptop-to-prod automation and dashboards deployed in production.
4. **Transfer** â€“ coaching, rituals, and continuous improvement with Kraft Builders or PEaaS.

The result is a delivery chain you can trust: faster releases, happier teams, and full control over your platform.
